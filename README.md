# Conway's-Game-of-Life
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a zero-player game that evolves over time based on simple rules applied to a grid of cells. Each cell can live, die, or reproduce depending on its neighbors. The rules are as follows:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The project includes an interactive interface to observe the simulation, along with options to customize the grid size, initial configurations, and step-through generations.
